## Summary

TypeScrpit port of the awesome library made by [Lea Verou](https://github.com/LeaVerou)

You can find the original project [here](https://github.com/LeaVerou/parsel)

Reason to do it is to learn more about CSS and its grammar but also to provide typings to another project I'm woring on and add some tweaks and fixes.

The idea is to remain consistent with the current API which you can read in the [official website](https://projects.verou.me/parsel).

## Release notes
